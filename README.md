## Reflection Prompts

### Provider
If you were going to add a new feature to this app that made sense to implement (in part) by extending the capabilities of the `WeatherProvider`, what would it be? Why? How would you extend `WeatherProvider` to do that?

If you were going to add a new feature where the implementation would best involve making a second additional provider, what would it be? Why?

### Accessibility Tools
You have now used the accessibility developer tool and screen reader to evaluate three of your apps: Nametag, Calculator, and this one. In addition you were to evaluate another persons app for the Calculator Audit.

Which developer tool did you use for identifying accessibility issues (Accessibility Scanner (Android), or Accessibility Inspector (iOS/macOS)) with your Weather app? Which screen reader did you use (TalkBack (Android), VoiceOver (iOS/macOS), or Narrator (Windows))? Were these the same tools you used for identifying problems in your partner's app for the Calculator Audit? 

What were your impressions of the accessibility tools you've used? Give examples of what worked well and what was not intuitive. If you have had the opportunity to use the tools on different platforms, what did you like about one over the other?
